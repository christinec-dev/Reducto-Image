# Reducto Image
Wouldn't it be easier if social media sites had built-in compression tools for when your profile picture is too large? Luckily, there are many compression tools out there for free, and so I tried making my own to practice my React skills. 

**_Reducto! ⚡_** Just click the button, or drag an image into the box, and once compressed, check it out in comparison to the original file, download, and viola - you're done! I made this with a cool package called react-image-file-resizer - which was super easy and quick to set up. The logo and all icons on this page was made with FontAwesome. You can test it out on Heroku, the link is above. This application is fully functional. 

Day five of trying to code in React on my own was a success. I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
